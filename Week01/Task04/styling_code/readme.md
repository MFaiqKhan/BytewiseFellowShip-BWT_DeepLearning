4-14. PEP 8: Look through the original PEP 8 style guide at https://python.org/
dev/peps/pep-0008/. You won’t use much of it now, but it might be interesting
to skim through it.

4-15. Code Review: Choose three of the programs you’ve written in this chapter
and modify each one to comply with PEP 8:

- Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert
four spaces every time you press tab, if you haven’t already done so (see
Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
- Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a
vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
- Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files.
