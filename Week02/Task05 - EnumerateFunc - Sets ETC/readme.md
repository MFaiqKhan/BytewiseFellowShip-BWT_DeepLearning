```
For task 5, the topic Timing your code is for your self-exploration. You have to search it out of the respurce, and then check the execution time of your code in different ways of code writing style. %timeit% helps you on an Ipython shell.

For example: Creating a list like
A = [ ]
A = list( )

Both have different time to complete, so we consider these small things that will grow exponentially when we move to bigger projects.
